# Stop-The-BSOD
A set of Windows Kernel challenges where you need to stop the BSDO from happening.

## How to use
Each challenge has a `README.md` file with the challenge description and a `SOLUTION.md` file with the solution.
I recommend you to try to solve the challenge by yourself before looking at the solution.

## Motivation
I created this set of challenges to help people learn about Windows Kernel development. I hope you enjoy it!
Some of the challenges are based on bugs I encountered during my time as I developed Windows Kernel drivers.

## Under Construction
This repository is under construction. I will add more challenges soon.
If you have any suggestions, please let me know. I will be happy to add them.
